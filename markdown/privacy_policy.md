My privacy policy is simple: **I don't track your usage, I do not collect or store any of your data EXCEPT IP addresses and a select few of basic HTTP information required for my web server to function.**

<br>

IP addresses are required to be logged in order for my web server ([NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/nginx/)) to communicate with your web browser effectively. Along with IPs Nginx may also log user-agent strings, browser types, operating systems, referral URLs, device information (e.g., device IDs), device settings, endpoints visited and search terms (these are automatically deleted in 15 days). These are all required for my entire web stack to function so if you dislike please don't use any of my services under this domain (including api.devgoldy.xyz and cdn.devgoldy.xyz). IP address are automatically deleted after 15 days.

<br>

Additionally, I do embed iframes from other sites, like iframes embedding YouTube videos on my blog posts; now YouTube and other sites may certainly load cookies in their iframes that may compromise your privacy. This is out of my control, for more information you'll have to visit the site's privacy policy (for example: YouTube's **[privacy policy](https://www.youtube.com/static?gl=GB&template=terms)**). However I will try my best to use the alternative no-cookie links but I cannot guarantee it, therefore I request for you to stay away from the blog portion (/blog or /blogs) of my site if you do not wish to have these third-party cookies on your machine or modify your browser (e.g via settings) to block cookies on this site.

<br>

This privacy policy is subject to change. When change does take place the date below "Privacy Policy" ("As of {date}") will update to the date the change occurred.
